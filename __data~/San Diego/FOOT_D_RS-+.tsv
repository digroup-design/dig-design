1	For lots where at least one-half of the front 50 feet of the lot depth has a minimum slope gradient of 25 percent, the setback closest to the street frontage may be reduced to a minimum 6 feet.
2	For lots greater than 50 feet in width, the required side setbacks may be reallocated where the combined dimension of each side setback would meet or exceed the combined total required in Table 131-04D, in which case side setbacks shall not be reduced to less than 4 feet, and street side setbacks shall not be reduced to less than 10 feet. Once a side setback is reallocated and established at a dimension less than the percentage indicated in Table 131-04D, all additions to the primary structure thereafter shall maintain the established side setback.
